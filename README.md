2.	Visualization  <br />
a.	Matplotlib  <br />
b.	Seaborn  <br />
c.	Bokeh  <br />
3.	Conclusions
Last summer, I worked through the University of Rhode Island and collected data for a local oyster farm using different instruments like tilt current meters and a water level logger. The pond that houses the oyster farm has an unpredictable nature and changing conditions like temperature, depth pressure, current direction, and current speed. By using visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh, I was able to draw a few different conclusions from my data. I discovered that rising and falling tides have a big effect on understanding the data. For example, the current seems to fall slightly faster than the rising and falls to the East. A buoy was attached to one of the tilt meters so that wind could affect the measured direction. I found that the correlation between wind direction and current direction is not amazing, implying that wind is not the only factor that drives current.
